          And it was at that age ... Poetry arrived in search of me. I don't
          know, I don't know where it came from, from winter or a river. I don't
          know how or when, no, they were not voices, they were not words, nor
          silence, but from a street I was summoned, frm the branches of night,
          abruptly from others, among violent fires or returning alone, there I
          was without a face and it touched me.
